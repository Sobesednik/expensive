# expensive

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/expensive.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/expensive)

```sh
npm i -g expensive
```

`expensive` is a [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) client to check domain availability, register domains, create Route 53 record zones and control domains' name servers via the CLI. The package significantly reduces the chore associated with performing these routine operations when creating new websites.

The CLI client can also perform web-based authentication via Chrome's automation to white-list IP addresses (useful when having dynamic IPs).

## Settings

Upon the first run the program will ask a series of questions:

```
username: <namecheap-username>
api key https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/: <api key accessed at the given page>
client ip [10.10.10.10]: <the ip>
```

After they've been answered, `expensive` will remember the answers and store them in `.expensiverc` file in the home directory, and use this data for all subsequent calls to the API. These are also available to other programs which want to use the API and can be read with `getConfig` when using the package programmatically (see below).

There are additional questions which are required for specific features:

```
Last 3 digit of phone to use for 2 factor auth: <055>
AWS access key id: <aws-key-id>
AWS secret access key: <aws-key>
```

These are stored in the `.expensive-client.rc` and are not shared with other software.

The last 3 digits will be used to automatically login and white-list an IP address, and aws keys are used for Route 53 access.

## `CLI`

The usage is as follows:

```fs
  expensive [command]

        domain          check a domain name in various tech zones
                        (.co, .cc, .io, .bz, .app)
        domain.com      check a domain name
        -h, --help      print usage information
```

```sh
expensive test
```

```fs
Checking 5 domains: test.co, test.cc, test.io, test.bz, test.app
None of the zones are available.
```

```sh
expensive testt
```

## API
<!--
The package also supports a Node.js API. The authentication is completed in the same way as the CLI, that is by reading the `.expensiverc` file or presenting questions. If `global` parameter is not set to true, and the `packageName` is not given, the function will throw. You must provide either a `packageName` or set `global` to true so that the `~/.expensiverc` can be read. N-O-N-E-T-H-E-L-E-S-S it is a good idea to provide a `packageName` so that a personal config in form of `.${packageName}-expensiverc` is generated. -->

On top of a CLI application, the package provides means to query _namecheap_ API.

### `getConfig(options: Object)`

Reads the `rc` file (or ask questions to create one) for given details: if `global` is set to true, the `HOME/.expensiverc` is looked up, and if `packageName` is provided, the `rc` file at `.${packageName}-expensiverc` is used for storing and reading of configuration. This makes possible for other libraries to refer to the same `rc` file with the API key, or have separate configurations.

- `packageName`: name of the package implementing `expensive`, or
- `global`: a boolean to indicate that the global `.expensiverc` should be used
- `opts`: other options accepted by [`africa`](https://npmjs.org/package/africa).

The `rc` file will only contain the following details required for API calls:

```sh
{
  "ApiUser": "namecheap_user",
  "ApiKey": "api_key_from_tools",
  "ClientIp": "10.10.10.10"
}
```

Client IP does not seem to have to be correct, although it has to be present and non-white-listed IPs won't work.

### `checkDomains`

This method returns a list of free domains for the request. Either domains, or a single domain must be passed. The method also expects to see Auth details (from the config object), and these can be passed by using the destructuring.

- `domains` an array of domains
- `domain` a single domain

```js
/* example/example.js */
/* yarn example/ */
import { getConfig, checkDomains } from 'expensive'
import { debuglog } from 'util'

const LOG = debuglog('expensive')
const DEBUG = /expensive/.test(process.env.NODE_DEBUG)

const domains = process.argv.slice(3)

if (!domains.length) {
  console.log('Please enter a domain or domains')
  process.exit()
}

(async () => {
  try {
    // use `.expensive-example.rc` file to get configuration data
    // pass `global` to read `.expensiverc` instead
    const Auth = await getConfig({ packageName: 'example' })

    console.log('Checking %s', domains.join(', '))
    const res = await checkDomains({
      ...Auth,
      domains,
    })
    if (res.length) {
      console.log('The following are free: %s', res.join(', '))
    } else {
      console.log('All domains are taken.')
    }
  } catch ({ stack, message }) {
    DEBUG ? LOG(stack) : console.error(message)
    process.exit(1)
  }
})()
```

```sh
yarn example/ test.co testt.co testtt.co
```

```sh
# yarn expansions
yarn run v1.7.0
yarn e example/example.js test.co testt.co testtt.co
node example example/example.js test.co testt.co testtt.co
```

```fs
