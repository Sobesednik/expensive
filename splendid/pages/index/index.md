# Expensive: CLI Domain Manager

Expensive is a tool that provides access to [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) service via
the CLI. It can be used to quickly retrieve the list of registered domains, view more precise
information about each of them, update host records by pointing the Apex domain to GitHub DNS
servers to enable GitHub pages integration, and also register domains.
