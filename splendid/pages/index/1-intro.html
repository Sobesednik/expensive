## Usage

These are the main commands:

<ul>
  * `expensive`: show the list of domains on the account, and navigate pages (20 domains per page)
  * `expensive` ``domain[.com][ domainN]``: check if domains are available. If the TLD is not supplied, the domain will be checked in 10 top zones. Can list any number of domains separated by spaces.
  * `expensive` ``domain.com -i``: display information about the owned domain, including DNS records if using Namecheap DNS.
  * `expensive` ``domain.com -r``: register the domain name via CLI. If applicable, will try to look up the coupon to get discount.
  * `expensive` ``domain.com -g``: point domain's DNS host records to GitHub DNS to switch on _GitHub Pages_.
