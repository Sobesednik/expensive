<!-- ## API -->
<!--
The package also supports a Node.js API. The authentication is completed in the same way as the CLI, that is by reading the `.expensiverc` file or presenting questions. If `global` parameter is not set to true, and the `packageName` is not given, the function will throw. You must provide either a `packageName` or set `global` to true so that the `~/.expensiverc` can be read. N-O-N-E-T-H-E-L-E-S-S it is a good idea to provide a `packageName` so that a personal config in form of `.${packageName}-expensiverc` is generated. -->

<!-- On top of the CLI application, the package provides means to query _namecheap_ API. To start using the API, a configuration can be read from a `.rc` file using `getConfig` method and passed to a client instance. -->
