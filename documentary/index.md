`expensive` is a [namecheap.com](https://bit.ly/31boSJg) client to check domain availability, obtain WHOIS information, register domains, update DNS hosts and control domains' name servers via the CLI. It allows to login using 2-factor authentication and white-list IP addresses without having to use the web interface. The package uses the [API](https://github.com/rqt/namecheap) and [Web API](https://github.com/rqt/namecheap-web) libraries to make requests.
