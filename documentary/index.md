# expensive

%NPM: expensive%

`expensive` is a [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) client to check domain availability, register domains, create Route 53 record zones and control domains' name servers via the CLI. The package significantly reduces the chore associated with performing these routine operations when creating new websites.

```sh
# install node with nvm https://github.com/creationix/nvm
npm i -g expensive
```

The CLI client can also perform web-based authentication via Chrome's automation to white-list IP addresses (useful when having dynamic IPs).
